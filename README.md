## Introduction

House price prediction is a crucial task in real estate, finance, and urban planning. This repository provides a complete workflow to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. We utilize a dataset of USA street house prices to analyze the data, preprocess it, and build predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to houses in the USA, such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Square footage
- Location (latitude and longitude)
- Year built
- Condition and quality of the house
- And more...

The dataset is available in the `data` directory. 

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tarunbh11/HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION.git
cd HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Usage

To run the analysis and model training, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical features.

    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

2. **Model Training:** Train the model using the preprocessed data.

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

    ```bash
    python predict.py --input new_data.csv --output predictions.csv
    ```

## Model

We explore several machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- 
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared score.

## Results

The results of the model training and evaluation are stored in the `results` directory. This includes:

- Evaluation metrics
- Plots of actual vs. predicted prices
- Feature importance
